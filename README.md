# ruby_caesar_cipher

A Success!

I was able to remember a much easier way to accomplish the Caesar Cipher. The challenging part of this exercise is not shifting the letter to another letter. The hardest part is getting the letters to wrap around the end and beginning of the alphabet. For example, "Z" plus a shift of 1 should return "A", and "A" plus a shift of -1 should return "Z". 

Instead of using many if statements, I was able to use an equation to wrap around the beginning and end of the alphabet. This wouldn't have been possible without the modulo operator. I was able to craft the majority of the equation by myself.
